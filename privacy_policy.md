(General Release version)

Thank you for using Code Scanner! This is an open-source scanner app that can read 1D/2D codes (Barcodes and QR codes respectively)

Before using this app, you should look at the privacy practices below:

## Definitions

`Code Scanner` - a code scanning application developed for Android™, which has a GitLab mirror at https://gitlab.com/czlucius/code-scanner-play.

`code` or `codes` - a 1D or 2D code from the list of supported codes, which can be found in Code Scanner’s app description on its active distribution channels.

## Data handling

Code Scanner is open-source, available under the GNU Affero General Public License; the app is released on the Google Play Store.

This application does not collect, nor does it transmit any Personally Identifiable Information from its users. Data processed by libraries used are described below.

Data stored in the “History” section, preferences in the “Preferences” section, and cache stored from creating QR codes in the “Create” section only resides on the device. 

App data may be transferred to another device through backups in the Android™ operating system by the user, in which the developers have no control of the privacy over the aforementioned Android backups containing this data. 

## Log/crash data
In case of an error or crash in the app, a prompt will be displayed for you to send log/crash data to the developer, for purposes of diagnostics and bug fixing. <be>

This Log Data includes:

This Log Data may include information such as app info, device model and name, operating system version, the configuration of the app when utilizing Code Scanner, and the time and date of your use of Code Scanner.<br>
It will also include logs from Android's log system (specific to Code Scanner only) which may include sensitive information.<br>

You will have a choice on whether to send this crash information to the developer. 

Currently, Code Scanner uses e-mail to send such data. If you do not wish to send the crash information, simply discard the e-mail draft, and no data will be sent.

You are, however, encouraged to send the crash data, as this would help the developer fix relevant bugs in Code Scanner.

If you wish to delete any crash logs you have sent, please send an email to czl.apps@icloud.com
